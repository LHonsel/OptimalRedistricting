One of the necessary conditions for democracy is a fair election procedure. In the US, however, gerrymandering has been flagged to pose a threat to fair elections in which one party gets the right to draw the voting district lines, potentially in their favor. By cracking and packing the voters, one can get a map that results in vastly different election outcomes that distort the true population preferences. In this project, we take a computational approach to redistricting proposing three algorithms for automatically drawing the voting district maps.

Project undertaken during the Harvard Kennedy Class "Data Science for Politics", taught by Benjamin Scnheer, with my fellow classmates Alexandru Socolov and Luca Mingardi. 

The report has beend written by by the three of us, but the code present on this github was written by me. In order to check their code please consult their github.
