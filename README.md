One of the necessary conditions for democracy is a fair election procedure. In the US, however, gerrymandering has been flagged to pose a threat to fair elections in which one party gets the right to draw the voting district lines, potentially in their favor. By cracking and packing the voters, one can get a map that results in vastly different election outcomes that distort the true population preferences. In this project, we take a computational approach to redistricting proposing three algorithms for automatically drawing the voting district maps.
